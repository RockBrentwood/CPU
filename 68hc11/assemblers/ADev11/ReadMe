Installation is simple. If you are reading this, and logically you must
be, then step 1 is done.
 2.  The directory containing this file and the other files unpacked from
       the archive should be added to your path.
 3.  If you like, make an assignment to this directory.  I use ADev11: as
       the logical name.  This is not required, but will work better in
       make files and source files if you ever decide to move this
       directory (ADev11:lib11.lib or ADev11:std_macros.inc).
 4.  Read the docs! I know you won't until you run into trouble, but make
       sure you have read them before you come to me for help.
 5.  You must copy either utils/HCBOOT or utils/HCBOOT_F1 to each project
       directory as HCBOOT so that when you issue HCload from there it will
       use the correct boot code for the processor used in that project.
       HCBOOT_F1_CONFIG is the same as HCBOOT_F1 except that it also allows
       programming of the CONFIG register.

SAsm, slink and slib now handle 68HC16 mnemonics and addressing modes as
far as I have been able to test.  I do not have a 68HC16 processor and
have relied on Motorola printed documents.

The docs files other than the .ps file are probably out of date.  They are
included only for those who don't have access to a postscript printer or
converter.
