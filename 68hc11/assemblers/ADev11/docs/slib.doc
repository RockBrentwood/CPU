SYNOPSIS

    slib [-a<1>] [-r<1>] [-l] [-c<1>] <library name>

            <1>  - one file

DESCRIPTION

Slib is the librarian for the DEV11 system. The following options are
recognized by slib:

-a              Specifies an object file that will be added to the
                library.  The -a option may be used more than once.

-c              Specifies a file that contains option commands to be
                processed by slib.  The file may be broken into lines,
                but each line must start with an option.  A command
                file can specify another command file and more than one
                command file can be used.  An example file might look as
                shown below.
                    -adownload.o
                    -rcowtown.o
                    -l

-l              Causes a listing of the library to be sent to the console
                (unless redirected). The listing includes the name of the
                module, its size (not the code size), and the symbols that
                are available from that module.  The -l option can be used
                more than once.

-r              Specifies an object module to be removed from the library.
                The -r option may be used more than once.

One and only one library must be specified for each invocation of slib.
