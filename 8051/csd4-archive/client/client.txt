(0) INTRODUCTION
   This is a simple communications program that runs a dumb tty from an IBM
compatible at 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (9600,N,8,1)
over COM2 for RS-232 compatible serial links.  With minor changes, it can also
be made to run at 57600,N,9,1.  This is illustrated in demo.c.

   These programs need to be compiled with MicroSoft's Quick C, version 2.5.
The nmake facility should also work with the make file given here.

(1) CLIENT
   A brief summary of the special keys follows:

   LEFT ARROW: Closes the serial port.  I wanted to have the ability to
               transmit control-C, so it has been disabled.
   DOWN ARROW: Starts a binary file transfer from the PC client.  Press ESCAPE
               to end.  All other keys are ignored during the transfer.
   UP ARROW:   Starts an ASCII transfer to the client, typically for logging
               sessions or receiving data transfers, such as an Intel Hex Format
               memory dump.  Press ESCAPE to end the transter.
