2021/08/13	Archive unpacked
		Makefile repaired.
		Operational baseline for pre-C90 established.
2021/08/13	Files renamed (to contemporary standards; i.e. *.h for header files).
		―	assm{0,1,2,3}.c → Assm{0,1,2,3}.c
		―	assm.d{1,2} → Assm{1,2}.h
		―	assmtest,assmtest.l → AssmTest.{in,ex}
		―	makefile,readme → Makefile,README
		―	as6502.notes,bootSA.note → {Assm6502,BootSA}.txt
		―	bootSA.asm → BootSA.s
		―	{as6502.1,user.nr} → {As6502,User}.1
		References to filenames in the code and documentation adjusted accordingly.
		History file and output for BootSA.s added.
2021/08/13	Normalize #define's in Assm0.c.
		Normalize layout in *.c and *.h.
		Toplogical sorting of routines in *.c.
		Replacement of in-line external declarations of C-library functions by standard headers.
2021/08/13	Operational baseline for C90 established.
		Header files renamed more transparently:
		―	Assm{1,2}.h → {Constants,Extern}.h
		Function declarations upgraded to prototypes and added to Extern.h.
		Implicit types converted to int or void.
		Inconsistent implicit types resolved (i.e. a void and integer return in the same function).
		‟static” added to defnitions of every variable and function that's file-local.
