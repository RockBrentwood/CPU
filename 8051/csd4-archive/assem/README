CAS: The Free Full-Featured 8051 Assembler
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This is an experimental public domain one-pass assembler for the 8051 processor that uses skip lists for its symbol table.
The source can be compiled on any system with an ANSI-C compiler (and sufficient memory), and DOS executables are provided.
The software was released, in 1992/07, located originally at
∙	csd4-archive:	ftp://csd4.csd.uwm.edu/pub/8051
∙	CAS assembler:	ftp://csd4.csd.uwm.edu/pub/8051/assem
It was subsequently stored, from 1993-on, at the FTP archive:
∙	csd4-archive:	ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/microprocs/MCS-51/csd4-archive/
∙	CAS assembler:	ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/microprocs/MCS-51/csd4-archive/assem
and at:
∙	CAS assembler:	ftp://lyman.pppl.gov/pub/8051/assem

This is a 1-pass assembler for the MCS-51 family of microprocessors with the following features:
∙	Seperately assembleable files.
	There are two stages of assembly:
	―	Pass 1: Creation of object files
	―	Pass 1 1/3: Linking of object files
∙	Relative addressing
∙	Unnamed segments
∙	Conditional assembly
	With a C-like syntax, e.g.
		if (Condition) {
			Assembly instructions...
		} else {
			Assembly instructions...
		}
∙	Multiple statements per line with C-like syntax.
∙	C-like expression syntax.
∙	Command-line options similar to those of the UNIX C compiler.
	Compatible with UNIX's make.
∙	An extensive archive of real-life assembly language programs, including a multi-tasking library.
Plus, if you don't want to learn all the elaborate ins and outs of this tool right away,
it is just as easy to use the first time out as any minimal assembler.

Read the start-up notes, Notes.txt, for details.
Also, take a look at the sample 8051 program provided in the subdirectory data, particularily the Makefile.

CAS has been tested and verified against all the software contained in the rest of the 8051 archive.

The following features are planned for future versions of this assembler,
possibly in conjunction with the convergence of this and the other assemblers on this archive site:
∙	More compatibility between the 8051 disassembler and assembler.
∙	A powerful macro facility, to allow significant customizations on the 8051 language.
∙	The ability to include "Pre-assembled" macros.

This is probably the most elaborate 8051 assembler you will find anywhere in the public domain.
It's yours with the source for free.

Be on the lookout for future software developments...
