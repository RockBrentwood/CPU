Included at the end is an rcs diff for the machine description file for the
6811 port of the gnu gcc compiler. This diff represents a patch to fix a
serious bug in the assembler output of the compiler.

The bug is the omission of a XGDX instruction when doing addition on
the stack pointer, causing garbage values to be loaded after a function call.
This bug manifests itself when more than 9 bytes is passed on the stack when
invoking a function.

To apply this patch, you can either run Larry Wall's patch program, or edit
the file by hand.

Good luck,

Otto
