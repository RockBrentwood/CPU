# This file is a form to be filled by uploaders.
# Filled forms will be installed to the archive with a suffix ".info"
# 
# You don't *have to* fill this; material can be installed to our archive
# without ".info"-files as well. But we think that a short description,
# which is available separately from the package, is a very useful thing:
# Too many ftp-archives in the world have only packed files,
# without any information of contents of those files. Those archives
# are too often considered useless.
#
# By filling this form, and posting it to us after your upload, you
# help to keep this archive useful. Other archive users and we (archive 
# maintainers) will appreciate your efforts.
# (note that /pub/microprocs is maintained totally by voluntary work !)
#
# Instructions for uploaders:
#	If you have something to upload, put it to the "incoming"
#	directory, and please write short answers to the following 
#	questions; then send the filled form to
#		microprocs-adm@nic.funet.fi
#	or put it to the incoming directory with suffix .info
#	(Example: if package name is comp.tar.Z, use comp.info
#	for info-form filename)
#	Please note that file protections used for the incoming
#	directory will not let you see what is in the directory.
#
# All lines beginning with "#" will be removed from the installed version
# of this file.
#
# NOTE! If you do not know the answer to some question(s), leave the
# field(s) empty. Don't guess. Even a minimal amount of information
# helps !

Introduction
     The PIC micro-controllers from Microchip have, for the type
of work that I do, proved themselves very useful.  It is easy to
use and has a simple instruction set.  But as a C programmer, I
don't always like to work with multiple assembler formats, one
for each micro-controller.  There exists too much to do and not
enough hours in the day.

     Each system has its own unique characteristics that need to
be remembered.  While that can be done, I'd rather not take the
time and clutter my mind with unnecessary information.  Rather,
I'd prefer to continue programming in C and forget the rest. 
(That's what reference manuals are for!)

     I purchased a Parallax development system for my projects,
but soon became frustrated at not having a C compiler available. 
Hence, a few hours programming and "Voila!", I can now do my PIC
programming in C.  The listings include the compiler along with
some sample code.  In the sample code you'll see some of the
characteristics of the PIC that make it unique.

     First, a PIC can only call 2 levels of subroutines.  If you
call 3, you'll NEVER return to the first.  That can be hair-
raising to have happen.  But having a C compiler can help you
control that problem.
