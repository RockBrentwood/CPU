This directory contains the file "assembly221-fixed.ps.Z", which is
assembly directions for the 1993 Revision 2.21 of the 6.270 Robot
Controller Board system.

This file is a modified version of the documentation created by the
current organizers of the 6.270 project (who can be reached by sending
e-mail to "6.270-organizers@athena.mit.edu").  The original file can
be found on FTP server aeneas.mit.edu in directory pub/ACS/6.270.

I fixed several PostScript bugs that were contained in the original
file, so the file may now be printed on normal PostScript devices (not
just Apple LaserWriters).

The file will print out approximately 85 pages long.
