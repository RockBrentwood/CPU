No, the LM386 is a single, -high power- op-amp.

The TIP120 power darlington performs a similar power-driver function
as did the LM386.

4.  The rev 2.21 uses a simplified infrared transmission circuit on
the main board, replacing an amplitude-controllable LM386 power op-amp
circuit with an on/off TIP120 darlington transistor.

There's the difference.  The LM386 allowed modulating the -strength-
of the IR output.  The TIP120 does not.

The two circuits require different software drivers.  Other than this,
either is functional and you should install the parts for whichever
one your board was made for.
