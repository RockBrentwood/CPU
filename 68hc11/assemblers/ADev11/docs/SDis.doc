    SDis

SYNOPSIS

    SDis <file name>


DESCRIPTION

SDis is the dis-assembler for the DEV11 system.  It accepts a Motorola
S-record format file and produces outputs a symbolic dis-assembled file
to stdout, by default the console.  This file is assembler (SAsm) ready
and would assemble to be exactly the same as the file that was
dis-assembled.

SDis is a tracking dis-assembler which means that it must have the
address of an executable instruction to start from.  Normally it gets
this from the S9 record if your file has one.  Otherwise or if other
addresses must be known, as might be the case with a monitor ROM with
many entry points, the dis-assembler asks for an address(es) to start
from.  A tracking dis-assembler will not attempt to dis-assemble data;
it knows the difference (but it can be intentionally fooled).
