6.270 board building tip:

Think about how you want to arrange the lone LED (is it the
IR indicator?) before building! If you follow the directions,
you will bury it under the expansion board and the TIP22 
transistor! My solution was to bend the TIP down to the 
left and at an angle. However, the pins are only just long enough
to do this. A better solution might be found with some planning
ahead.

Good luck,
Gary
