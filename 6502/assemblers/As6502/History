1986		Original Author: J. H. Van Ornum at AT&T Bell Laboratories.
1987/08/22	Adapted from the earlier source and re-released by Joel Swank.
2021/08/13	Archive unpacked.
		Makefile repaired.
		Operational baseline for pre-C90 established.
2021/08/13	Files renamed (to contemporary standards; i.e. *.h for header files).
		―	assm{0,1,2,3}.c → Assm{0,1,2,3}.c
		―	assm.d{1,2} → Assm{1,2}.h
		―	assmtest,assmtest.l → AssmTest.{in,ex}
		―	makefile,readme → Makefile,README
		―	as6502.notes,bootSA.note → {Assm6502,BootSA}.txt
		―	bootSA.asm → BootSA.s
		―	{as6502.1,user.nr} → {As6502,User}.1
		References to filenames in the code and documentation adjusted accordingly.
		History file and output for BootSA.s added.
2021/08/13	Normalize #define's in Assm0.c.
		Normalize layout in *.c and *.h.
		Toplogical sorting of routines in *.c.
		Replacement of in-line external declarations of C-library functions by standard headers.
2021/08/13	Operational baseline for C90 established.
		Header files renamed more transparently:
		―	Assm{1,2}.h → {Constants,Extern}.h
		Function declarations upgraded to prototypes and added to Extern.h.
		Implicit types converted to int or void.
		Inconsistent implicit types resolved (i.e. a void and integer return in the same function).
		‟static” added to defnitions of every variable and function that's file-local.
2021/08/13	Assm6502.txt → User.txt, which is the compiled version of User.1.
		Compiled As6502.1, by hand, into As6502.txt
		Translated User.txt, by hand, retaining the earlier version as User.man.
		The file was ultimately converted from an easlier version, which was derived by nroff from User.1.
		Moved {As6502.User}.{1,man,txt} into the Doc subdirectory.
		Moved {AssmTest}.{ex,in}, BootSA.{ex,s,txt} into the Test subdirectory.
