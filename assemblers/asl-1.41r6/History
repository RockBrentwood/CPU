		Untangling the system-dependency matrix.
2021/08/15	Attempt to establish initial configuration for operational baseline.
		Only 4/55 tests succeed.
		Layout normalization round 1: trimming line-end whitespace.
		No degradation: 4/55 tests succeed.
2021/08/15	Layout normalization round 2: removal of the Pascalisms from the C code.
		The "C in Pascal" re-defines interfere with the layout phase and readibility of the code.
		No degradation: 4/55 tests succeed.
2021/08/15	Layout normalization round 3: normalized C indentation and layout.
		Locking in function prototypes, removing "PROTOS".
		No degradation: 4/55 tests succeed.
		Versions 1.41r{7,8} are even less viable: the bounds check errors occur even during the build process.
2021/08/15	Pre-C90 operational baseline established.
		Recoding, bug fixes: eliminated the strcat(), strcpy() related bounds check errors.
