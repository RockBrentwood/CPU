No it has to be greater than 6 volts in order to charge the battery.
If you used a 6 volt supply, your batteries would be charging the
adapter (well not really, but you get the idea).

Figure a couple of volts above the desired battery voltage, and add a
couple volts for the diode drops in the bridge rectifier.  We use 12
volts supplies for 6 volts batteries.

Also, get the strongest (i.e., greatest ampere capacity) adapter you
can get your hands on.  We use a 2 amp adapter, which is pretty hefty.
If you go below an amp, your charge rate will be limited by your
adapter, and your adapter will be pushed to its limits.

I use a spare PC power supply with a 10 ohm 20 watt load on it to preload it
and maintain good regulation.  They're typically rated at around 5 to 10 amps
on the 12 V output and work well.  Plus they're VERY common.
