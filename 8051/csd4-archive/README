In this archive, the following items have been packaged:
∙	C source for an 8051 assembler and disassembler.
	The assembler generates Intel Hex Format output, and the disassembler reads files in Intel Hex Format.
∙	Arbitrary precision arithmetic routines for unsigned integers including Multiplication, Division, Square Root.
∙	A rudimentary debugger, needs client software at the host in order to be useable.
∙	A small multi-threading run-time kernel, with 8051 demo software for:
        ―	Serial Communications
		client software for a PC host at 57600,N,9,1 available,
        ―	Intel Hex download,
        ―	CRC Check Summing Demo
		also needs client software running at the host,
        ―	Interrupt Input Processing, for the 8051FA,
        ―	Open-loop Stepper Motor Driver,
        ―	LCD Display/Keypad Input library,
        ―	Pulse Counting/Data Collection
		elaborate multi-tasking control used to concurrently process the 6 timer-capture interrupts of the 8051FA.

Consider this software your development kit.
You can use it in your projects any way you like with no licensing or copyright restrictions.
If you'd like to try your hand at hacking it I encourage you to do so
and to distribute any substantial improvements you may come up in the same spirit that this is being distributed:
free of any restrictions.

Everything here is new and original and was generated over a one year period 4/91 to 4/92
(except for the assembler) to be used to support work on projects and turn-key systems developed during and after that time.
The assembler was developed in 7/92.
