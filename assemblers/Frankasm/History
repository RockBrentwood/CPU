History:
1987/09:	frapsub.c:	As part of the Framework Cross-Assembler for UNIX.
1987/09/13:	fryylex.c:	As part of the Framework Cross-Assembler for UNIX.
1987/09/14:	fryylex.c:	DOS'ify, 6 char unique names.
1987/09/15:	frasmdat.h
1987/09/19:	Framework cross-assembler syntax files.
		Usage: framework cross-assembler, UNIX.
		Mark Zenier
		as6301.y:	Originally in fraselcrit.h.
				Selection criteria and token values for the 6301 framework assembler.
		as6805.y:	Originally in fraselcrit.h.
				Mark Zenier
				Selection criteria and token values for the 6805 framework assembler.
		as6811.y:	Originally in fraselcrit.h.
				Selection criteria and token values for the 6811 framework assembler.
1987/09/25:	frasmain.c
1987/09/25:	as*.y:		Opcode and Instruction generation tables (fraptabdef.c):
				As part of the Framework Cross-Assembler for UNIX.
				CodeTab[], ModeTab[] and AddrTab[] were originally in fraptabdef.c.
1987/09/27:	fraosub.c
1987/10/02:	as6805.y:	Revision, no description provided.
				Possibly, the separation of fraselcrit.h into crit{6301,6805,6811}.h.
1987/10/28:	asZ8.y:		Originally critz8.h.
				Selection criteria and syntax type constants for the Z8 framework assembler.
1988/01/22:	asZ80.y:	Originally critz80.h.
				Selection criteria and syntax type defines for the Z80 frasm (framework cross assembler).
1988/02/02:	as*.y:		Frame work parser description for framework cross assemblers.
				Possibly, the generation of or splitting into separate YACC source files from a common source.
1988/03/15:	fraosub.c:	Release 1.1 WIDTH.
1988/08/03:	frasmain.c:	version 1.4
		frasmdat.h:	Global
1989/06/07:	as6805.y:	Fix relative addressing (BRset/clr).
1990/01/30:	Version 2.0 ported to the Amiga, compiled with gcc 2.7.0.
		Ruediger Deppe.
1990/09/11:	as*.y:		Merge table definition.
1990/09/12:	as*.y:		Short file names.
1990/09/14:	{frasmain,frapsub,fraosub}.c, frasmdat.h:	version 1.5, DOS'ified 6-character unique, portable variable names.
1990/09/14:	as*.y:		Short variable names.
1990/09/17:	as*.y:		Use yylex as external.
1990/10:	fryylex.c:	Hand-carved scanner.
1990/11/17:	as*.y:		Character set support (explicitly stated as such, only in as1805.y).
1990/12/04-06:	Posted to alt.sources.
		See Cover.txt for the article headers.
		Note: not all alt.sources servers archived the Frankasm/As630102 SHAR file.
2020/03/20:	Unpacked
2021/07/28:	Source files normalized:
		∙	excess spaces trimmed,
		∙	all history-related comments have been collated and moved to the file ‟History”.
2021/07/28:	Established operational baseline in ANSI-C.
		The end-of-line spaces in the test output files for the 6301, 6811 and z8 were adjusted to match actual output.
		The 6502 test output, in both this version and the original, has an invalid opcode error for ‟mul”.
		The 2650 test output, in both this version and the original, has a page boundary warning.
		There is an (as-yet-unresolved) mismatch in the 6809 test output.
2021/07/28:	Toplogical sorting of routines.
2021/07/28:	Source file layout regularized,
2021/07/29:	Used <stdlib.h> in place of explicit declarations of functions that declared there in C99.
		Pre-C90 function definition headers were made C90 function prototypes.
		Non-typed routines were remade as void or int.
		Function declarations added to frasmdat.h.
		Made <string.h> mandatory.
		Took out NOSTRING - this breaks support for legacy V7; but V7's compiler "pcc" has been rewritten to support C99.
2021/07/30:	Established operational baseline in C99.
2021/08/03:	Replaced mktemp() by mkstemp().
2021/08/04:	Replaced index() by strchr(), which is now C99, and took out USEINDEX.
2021/08/04:	Recovered Frankasm/As630102 and as6301.y and normalized it with the changes already made to the other *.y files.
2021/08/08:	Removed the ‟register” keyword.
