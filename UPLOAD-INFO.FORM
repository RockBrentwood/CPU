# This file is a form to be filled by uploaders.
# Filled forms will be installed to the archive with a suffix ".info"
# 
# You don't *have to* fill this; material can be installed to our archive
# without ".info"-files as well. But we think that a short description,
# which is available separately from the package, is a very useful thing:
# Too many ftp-archives in the world have only packed files,
# without any information of contents of those files. Those archives
# are too often considered useless.
#
# By filling this form, and posting it to us after your upload, you
# help to keep this archive useful. Other archive users and we (archive 
# maintainers) will appreciate your efforts.
# (note that /pub/microprocs is maintained totally by voluntary work !)
#
# Instructions for uploaders:
#	If you have something to upload, put it to the "incoming"
#	directory, and please write short answers to the following 
#	questions; then send the filled form to
#		microprocs-adm@nic.funet.fi
#	or put it to the incoming directory with suffix .info
#	(Example: if package name is comp.tar.Z, use comp.info
#	for info-form filename)
#	Please note that file protections used for the incoming
#	directory will not let you see what is in the directory.
#
# All lines beginning with "#" will be removed from the installed version
# of this file.
#
# NOTE! If you do not know the answer to some question(s), leave the
# field(s) empty. Don't guess. Even a minimal amount of information
# helps !

One-Line-Description-Of-The-Packet:

# Example:
#   One-Line-Description-Of-The-Packet:
#     The ultimate compiler, any lang -> any processor
#


Longer-Description:

# You can fill this by cutting a piece of README-file or manual page of 
# the package, and inserting it here, or by writing a longer description.
# Some 10 or 20 lines should usually be enough.
# If you think that the uploaded package is described well enough by
# the one-line description, leave this field empty.

# Write "yes" here, if you are the author. 


Bug-Report-Email-Address:
