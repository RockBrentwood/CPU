Yes, there was a message sent out right after I sent out the Rev 2.11
boards.  Paul Malenfant discovered that there was a mistake made when
they made the boards.  There is a hole that is plated through on the
main board that is not supposed to be.  It touches both the ground plane
and the 5V plane.

If you hold the component side up with the power switch in the lower
left corner, then the hole is on the right side of the board, halfway
up, near Capacitor C4.  You need to use either a small drill bit to
remove the plating, or an x-acto knife.  Be careful, because there are
some small traces nearby.

If you need more info/help, send me personal E-mail.
