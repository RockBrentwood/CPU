Subject:benchmarking program available
--------
I have installed a program to test what percent of your CPU is taken
up by background processes (IR reception, shaft encoder routines,
and the like).  

The program lives in a file named "benchmrk.c" in the IC library
directory.  After loading the file, the function "float benchmark()"
will be defined.

The benchmark() routine returns a number approximating the percentage
of CPU cycles AVAILABLE FOR USER PROGRAMS.

Following is a sample transcript.  Notice the difference after the
infrared reception software is enabled.
