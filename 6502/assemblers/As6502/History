		Two changes to version 1.4 have been made to "port" As6502 to CP/M(tm).
		A "tolower()" function call was add to the command line processing code
		to (re)map the command line arguments to lower case (CP/M converts all command line arguments to upper case).
		The readline() function has code added to "ignore" the '\r' character
		(CP/M includes the \r character along with \n).

		Also, the ability to process multiple files on the command line has been added.
		Now one can do, for example:
			As6502 -nisvo header.file source.file data.file ...

		Had to take out tolower call to work on 4.2bsd.
1986/12/02	Joel Swank
		Added USAGE message in place of Invalid count message.
1986/12		Joel Swank
		Added paging-related features.
		Added object code record generation routines to generate MOS Technology format object records.
1987/03/01	Joel Swank
		Version 5.0 ported to the Amiga.
		Version 5.0 is a major revision by Joel Swank.
		It adds the following features:
		―	'.PAGE' pseudo with optional title;
		―	automatic paging and -p flag to specify page length;
		―	a sorted symbol cross reference;
		―	-t flag to specify the symbol table size;
		―	-w flag to specify the width of a listing line.
		―	The -m option causes the object file to be formatted as a standard MOS Technology object file.
		―	Also added error checking and error messages to the argument parsing routine.
1987/08/22	Archived and released by Joel Swank.
2021/08/13	Archive unpacked.
		Makefile repaired.
		Operational baseline for pre-C90 established.
2021/08/13	Files renamed (to contemporary standards; i.e. *.h for header files).
		―	assm{0,1,2,3}.c → Assm{0,1,2,3}.c
		―	assm.d{1,2} → Assm{1,2}.h
		―	assmtest,assmtest.l → AssmTest.{in,ex}
		―	makefile,readme → Makefile,README
		―	as6502.notes,bootSA.note → {Assm6502,BootSA}.txt
		―	bootSA.asm → BootSA.s
		―	{as6502.1,user.nr} → {As6502,User}.1
		References to filenames in the code and documentation adjusted accordingly.
		History file and output for BootSA.s added.
2021/08/13	Normalize #define's in Assm0.c.
		Normalize layout in *.c and *.h.
		Toplogical sorting of routines in *.c.
		Replacement of in-line external declarations of C-library functions by standard headers.
2021/08/13	Operational baseline for C90 established.
		Header files renamed more transparently:
		―	Assm{1,2}.h → {Constants,Extern}.h
		Function declarations upgraded to prototypes and added to Extern.h.
		Implicit types converted to int or void.
		Inconsistent implicit types resolved (i.e. a void and integer return in the same function).
		‟static” added to defnitions of every variable and function that's file-local.
2021/08/13	Assm6502.txt → User.txt, which is the compiled version of User.1.
		Compiled As6502.1, by hand, into As6502.txt
		Translated User.txt, by hand, retaining the earlier version as User.man.
		The file was ultimately converted from an easlier version, which was derived by nroff from User.1.
		Moved {As6502.User}.{1,man,txt} into the Doc subdirectory.
		Moved {AssmTest}.{ex,in}, BootSA.{ex,s,txt} into the Test subdirectory.
2021/08/14	Remove the ‟register” keyword.
		Rendered into optimized, idiomatic, nativized C.
2021/08/14	Added <stdbool.h>.
		Lifted integer-valued boolean variables and functions to ‟bool”.
