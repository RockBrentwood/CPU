                 8051 RELOCATER, notes on use.

(0) COMMAND LINE, INPUT FORMAT
   This is a simple utility to relocate hex files.  A typical use would be
the following: you assemble a stand-alone program for address 0.  However,
when loading the program in preparation to blast it into EPROM, you have to
upload it to memory address 4000 and then blast it to address 0. 

   The typical conmmand line for this utility is:

                     reloc Offset File

For example:
                     reloc 4000 debug

will take the file debug.hex and generate the output in debug.hx.  The input
file must be suffixed in .hex, and the output will always have the .hx suffix.

   The offset must be a 4-digit hexadecimal number.  The source file's
addresses are shifted by the amount indicated by this offset.  Address
calculations are done modulo 10000 hex, so an offset of c000 will effectively
shift addresses at or above 4000 back by 4000.
