  This directory contains the source for a portable 6502 assembler
written in C. I captured it from the net and improved it and ported
it to the Amiga. I compiled it under Manx. The port required only
minor changes. There are 2 documentation files - as6502.man and
as6502.notes.  The source in UNIX nroff format for these files are
as6502.1 (use -man) and user.nr respectively. A test source file,
assmtest, and the resulting listing file, assmtest.l, are included.
These can be used to check functions after compiling. Type the
following:
as6502 -nsv assmtest >temp
then compare temp to assmtest.l. They should be the same except for
the dates in the headings.
