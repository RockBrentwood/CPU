ASPIC, available as shareware from several ftp sites, Microchip BBS, and 
the author's support BBS ((604) 597-3479), is 5 to 20 times faster than 
MPALC or MPASM. It's powerful features allow considerable code compression, 
since they make complex constructs much more maintainable.

It has some unique features such as character set translation, automatic 
register bank management, text packing, true bit labels, full support for 
IDE's like Brief, Codewrite, Winedit and Multiedit (even with multi-file 
projects). It also works properly in makefiles, supports environment 
variables, allows fuse and EEPROM data definition, automatically generates 
RETLW tables, and more.

A complete working source code is provided as a code framework. It is 
called DEMO.ZIP, and it is the complete source of a pocket logic analyzer 
with LCD, KEYBOARD, etc. (Registered users also get the schematics and 
block diagram).

Sorry if that sounded a bit biased, but I actually did try to use 
restraint.
