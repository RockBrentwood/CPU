The IO Keypad/LCD Demo
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
0. Overview
───────────
This demo is meant to be used with the io_lib.s software.
For the routines in this archive that this was defined to be used with,
its primary function has been to verify and test the keypad and LCD hardware, and the associated circuitry.

1. Command Summary
──────────────────
To run this demo, you will either need:
∙	compatible hardware to use with io_lib.s or
∙	to write your own emulator for the io_lib.s routines.
	The emulator could be, for instance, a set of routines that communicate with a client over an RS-232 line.

You will need to locate the keys that correspond to the numeric values 0 to 15 before using this demo,
since all the commands are executed from the keypad.

	IO Demo Command Summary
	―――――――――――――――――――――――
	Command	Function
	―――――――	――――――――
	0 NN	cputs(NN)
	1	clear
	2	home
	3 N	set_cursor(N)
	4	cursor_left
	5	cursor_right
	6	shift_left
	7	shift_right
	8 RC	locate(Row, Col)
	9	scr_init
	10	cputs(‟This is a test”)
	11	save_cursor
	12	restore_cursor

The numerical inputs, NN, N and RC are keyed in from the keypad following the command, one hexadecimal digit at a time.
The keys 0 to 15 are mapped onto the hexadecimal digits 0-9, a-f respectively.
The numbers NN and RC are two hexadecimal digits, and N is one.

Because of the constraints on the command format, it will not be possible to ‟locate” past column 15 using the command 8.
The first hex digit (R) is the row where the cursor is to be located, and the second is the cursor's new column,
which cannot be larger than 16.

The commands listed above are all described in io.txt.
