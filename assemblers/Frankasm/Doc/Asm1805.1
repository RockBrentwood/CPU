.SH NOTES
There is only one input file.

The program can select which subset of instructions is accepted.
The program first uses the name with which it is invoked.
This is scanned for a substring which indicates which set to use.
The -p options overrides this selction by performing the same substring
search.

There should only be one executable file with all of its names linked to it.
