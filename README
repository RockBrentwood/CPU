This archive is derived from the original at
	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/microprocs
and is being slated for future expansion.
It contains the Frankenstein cross-assembler, as well as the CAS 8051 assember,
and other tools and utilities for microcontroller CPUs.

The FTP archive may be accessed over the web at
        http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/microprocs/
The changes made relative to the original, at the FTP site, along with the listings of the original contents of the GitHub version, are under Manifest.txt.

The following is the README contained in the original, minus the original contact e-mail reference, and is subject to future change, after this archive is populated.

/pub/microprocs @ ftp.funet.fi:
the microprocessor (software) developers' archive
-------------------------------------------------

Note: This archive is one of the newest areas at ftp.funet.fi (alias 
nic.funet.fi). It is still under construction; one day there may even
be a proper readme-file :-). This means that almost everything can be
changed in the near future.

This archive consists of (actually, *will consist of):
	* Tools:
	  microprocessor software development tools (mostly cross-compilers,
	  simulators, etc), running on some host computer.
	  We prefer source code for these tools, binary-only distributions
	  will not be available unless there are really good reasons...
	* Target system (=microprocessor-based system) software:
	  (e.g. monitor programs, library routines, etc. in assembly and 
	  other languages) for "no particular system" (i.e. not for any 
	  specific OS, unless the OS is included also)
	* documents
	* probably other related material, too.

Please note that everything you'll find here have not been tested by
archive maintainers, as testing is usually impossible since we don't
have all and every target system that are (or may be) supported by
these software packages.

Most of things that are here are (will be) sorted to two or more directory 
structures: To the first by target system, and to the second by subject 
(all except one of these are symbolic links).
(e.g. If there are multiple target systems, there will be multiple links
from various directory structures).

Currently we have following main-level directories (most of these
are still empty):
	Target-system-based sorting:
	  6809		Motorola 6809 family (6809, 6809E)
	  6800		Motorola 6800 family (6800, 6802, 6808)
	  6801		Motorola 6801 family (6801, 6801) (superset of 6800)
	  6805		Motorola 6805 family (many members)
	  68hc11	Motorola 68hc11 family (many members) (superset of 6801)

	  6309		superset of 6809, made by Hitachi

	  H8/330	Hitachi H8 family (GNU C available)

	  MCS-48	Intel MCS-48 family (8048 and others)
	  MCS-51	Intel MCS-51 family (8051,8032 and others)
	  MCS-80	Intel MCS-80 family (8080)

	  PIC		Microchip PIC family

	  Z8		Zilog Z8 family
	  Z80		Zilog Z80 family

	Subject-based sorting:
	  assemblers	-compilers
	  c-compilers
	  simulators

	Other directories:
	  incoming	If you have something to upload, put it here, and
			please take UPLOAD-INFO.FORM, write answers to
			the questions and send it to us by email (to
			microprocs-adm@nic.funet.fi)
	  other-archives	copies of other archives

	Files:
	  README	This file
	  UPLOAD-INFO.FORM	to be filled after uploads


	(others will be added when necessary)
