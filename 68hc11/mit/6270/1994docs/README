This directory contains the notes from the 1994 6.270 MIT LEGO Robot
Design Contest.

I have taken the 11 meg PS file distributed by the current organizers
and split it up into its component chapters.  The table of contents
chapter (toc.PS.Z) is 26 pages; the remaining chapters and appendices
comprise 254 pages.

These files is available here for your convenience only.  The original
distribution is the file on aeneas.mit.edu in
/pub/ACS/6.270/1994/notes1994.ps.Z.
