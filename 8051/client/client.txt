8051 Client
━━━━━━━━━━━
0. Introduction
───────────────
This is a simple communications program that runs a dumb tty from an IBM compatible
at 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (9600,N,8,1) over COM2 for RS-232 compatible serial links.
With minor changes, it can also be made to run at 57600,N,9,1.
This is illustrated in demo.c.

These programs need to be compiled with MicroSoft's Quick C, version 2.5.
The nmake facility should also work with the make file given here.

A future revision may be done with the SDL library or in the QT framework with I/O generalized using sockets and pipes.

A brief summary of the special keys follows:
∙	Left Arrow:
	Closes the serial port.
	I wanted to have the ability to transmit control-C, so it has been disabled.
∙	Down Arrow:
	Starts a binary file transfer from the PC client.
	Press the Escape key (Esc) to end.
	All other keys are ignored during the transfer.
∙	Up Arrow:
	Starts an ASCII transfer to the client,
	typically for logging sessions or receiving data transfers, such as an Intel Hex Format memory dump.
	Press the Escape key (Esc) to end the transter.
