I believe the debugging instructions that claim that the yellow light
should flicker are incorrect.  

(As you may know, I didn't write the latest revisions to the doc's.)

The way it should work as you observed.  The board should reset into
Special Test mode: this is the normal running mode (see the discussion
about how the LCD works for an explanation).

To get the board into Special Bootstrap (that is, "download mode"),
you must hold down either the Choose or Escape button (I don't know
which it is, sorry) and press reset.  When the board comes out of
reset, it will be in Bootstrap (with the yellow LED completely off.)

The 300 ms delay is caused by the Dallas DS1233 reset monitor chip and
-not- an RC delay line as described in the board docs.  This is the
significant change from the 2.1x-2.20 boards to the 2.21 board.  It
seems that the new organizers have not taken the time to revise the
technical discussion of how the board works.

As I indicated, I believe your board is working.  Try resetting with
the Choose or Escape button held down, and see if the yellow lamp goes
off.  If so, you're in business.

OK, we're making progress.

First, your board is probably OK.  The fact that the yellow light goes
out means (with very high certainty) that the 6811 is properly
resetting into its bootstrap mode.

Second.  The most frequent cause of problems w/download is an
improperly wired serial connection.

When you plug your board into your computer, the green LED (serial
receive) should turn on.  If it does not, then it's almost guaranteed
that your cable is wired improperly.  (The only exception I know to
this is when using Macs:  the Mac serial output driver doesn't turn on
until the software tells it to.)

Try swapping the TxD and RxD wires on your cable.  This is probably
the problem.  Then try again.  You might want to have your board
plugged in, with the green LED on, and then reset the board to
download (yellow LED off).  At this point, your board should be ready
to perform the download sequence.

Good luck.  Let us know the results.
