This directory contains printed circuit board artwork for the 6.270
MIT Robot Design Competition hardware.

Note:  This artwork is Copyright (C) by Randy Sargent,Fred Martin, and MIT 
1992.  Permission is granted to use this artwork for any purpose, commercial
or otherwise, provided that full credit is prominently given to the
original authors of the work.

File "6270v211.sit.hqx" is a Binhex'ed version of a StuffIt archive
(for the Mac).  You will need "StuffIt" or "StuffIt Deluxe" to decode
the archive.

When you are done decoding, two files will be created:  the foil
patterns and the component silkscreen.  These PCB files were created
by the Profession Layout (R) software package sold by Douglas
Electronics, Inc.

You can send these files to Douglas Electronics and they will send you
film panels which you can bring to your favorite PC board manufacturer
for board fabrication.  When you send the files to them, make sure to
request: component layer, solder layer, component layer solder mask,
solder layer solder mask, silkscreen layer, and drill guide.  These
six panels are used by your PCB manufacturer to make boards.

Douglas Electronics can also do the PC board fabrication if you like,
but they are pretty expensive (though convenient).  Talk to them for
pricing and delivery.

Douglas Electronics can be reached at: Douglas Electronics; 2777
Alvarado St; San Leandro, CA 94577; (voice) (510) 483 8770.

The file "rev2.1-schematics.sea.hqx" contains the schematics for the
board, done using the DesignWORKS schematics package for the Mac.
These files are perfectly useless unless you have this particular
piece of software (it's also sold by Douglas Electronics).  Please
don't ask me to provide schematics in any other form; PostScript
versions of the schematics are included in the documentation.

The files with suffix ".gbr" are supposed to be Gerber-format text
files.  I cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of these
files; however, they may still be useful to some.  The files are the
following: 

	V211comp.gbr		component side of boards
	V211sold.gbr		solder side of boards
	V211hole.gbr		drill guide
 	V211silk.gbr		silkscreen printing

Please let me know if there are any question or problems with using
these files.
