1990/12/04-06:	Posted to alt.sources.
		See Cover.txt for the article headers.
		Note: not all alt.sources servers archived the Frankasm/As630102 SHAR file.
2020/03/20:	Unpacked
2021/07/28:	Source files normalized:
		∙	excess spaces trimmed,
		∙	all history-related comments have been collated and moved to the file ‟History”.
2021/07/28:	Established operational baseline in ANSI-C.
		The end-of-line spaces in the test output files for the 6301, 6811 and z8 were adjusted to match actual output.
		The 6502 test output, in both this version and the original, has an invalid opcode error for ‟mul”.
		The 2650 test output, in both this version and the original, has a page boundary warning.
		There is an (as-yet-unresolved) mismatch in the 6809 test output.
2021/07/28:	Toplogical sorting of routines.
		Pre-C90 function definition headers were made C90 function prototypes.
		Remade non-typed routines void or int.
		Added function declarations Extern.h.
		Regularized the source file names and layout (partly to set up and/or clean up "make clean/clobber/test"):
		―	Test files to Test/
		―	Documentation files to Doc/
		―	Syntax files renamed as«cpu».y → Syn«CPU».y, with «cpu»={z8,z80} → «CPU»={Z8,Z80}.
		―	Test files renamed as«cpu».{tst,tut} → As«CPU».{in,ex}.
		┈	Documentation files renamed as«cpu»{.1,.doc} → Asm«CPU»{.1,A.1}.
		―	{devnotes,filelist} → {Notes,Manifest}.txt.
		―	makefile.dos → Makefile.dos.
		―	fraytok.h → Token.h.
		―	{fraecon,frasmdat}.h → {Constants,Extern}.h.
		―       {fraeuni,fraebin,getopt}.h → {CasesUn,CasesBin,GetOpt}.c.
		―	{frasmain,fryylex,frapsub,fraosub}.c → {Assem,Scan,Reader,Writer}.c.
		―	The history, manifest and documentation were retrofitted with the new names.
		Converted the conditional module GetOpt.c into a module for a ‟fall-back” GetOpt() to getopt().
		Upgrading to C99: made <string.h> and <stdlib.h> mandatory.
		Documentation and test files placed, respectively, in Doc and Test subdirectories and the Makefile was updated.
		Took out NOSTRING - this breaks support for legacy V7; but V7's compiler "pcc" has been rewritten to support C99.
		Remade the build process and Makefiles.
2021/07/29:	Added ‟bool” as ‟typedef enum { false, true } bool;”, for now.
		Lifted boolean-valued integer variables and routines to the type bool.
		Sorted out the globals in Extern.h.
		Removed Global, localized ‟global” routines and variables that are actually local and sorted out the rest.
		Used <stdlib.h> in place of explicit declarations of functions that declared there in C99.
		Normalized local variable declarations to initialized declarations at point-of-first-use with maximum locality.
2021/07/30:	Established operational baseline in C99.
2021/08/01:	Cleaned up the syntax files.
		Added make test and make clobber.
		Renamed make newmachine as make cleancpu and cleaned it up.
		Regularized the makefiles.
		Integrated the ‟cleanup.bat” and ‟makeone.bat” scripts into the DOS makefile.
2021/08/02:	Replaced most sizeof-related manifest constants by constants or eliminated them.
2021/08/03:	Replaced mktemp() by mkstemp().
2021/08/04:	Replaced index() by strchr(), which is now C99, and took out USEINDEX.
2021/08/04:	Recovered Frankasm/As630102 and Syn6301.y and normalized it with the changes already made to the other *.y files.
2021/08/07:	Converted manifest constant groups to enum types; and lifted variables and routines to these enum types.
2021/08/09:	Further cleanup of the makefiles; bringing the DOS and non-DOS versions into line.
		Removed the ‟register” keyword.
		Replaced typedef ‟bool” by <stdbool.h>.
2021/08/11:	Removed the ‟add-on” includes; replacing them by modules.
                Converted the ‟add-on” include GetOpt.c into a separately-compiled file.
                Took back out the ‟add-on” includes Cases{Un,Bin}.h and combined them into a separately-compiled file: ExOp.c.
                Make corresponding changes to other files to reflect the changes.
2021/08/12:	Minor fixes to the Makefiles to remove redundant builds.
