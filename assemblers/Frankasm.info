	Subject: Frankenstein Cross Assemblers

	Here is a hobby grade cross assembler for Unix and Dos for
	a number of microprocessors.  The various flavors of assember
	are determined by which Yacc input file is used.

	13 sets of "Flavor" files will follow
	1805, 2650, 6301, 6502, 6805, 6809, 6811, tms7000, 8048, 8051, 
	8096, z8 and z80

	No macros, relocatable linkers, fancy print controls or 
	structured control statments.  But its a start.
