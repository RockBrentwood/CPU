Update Note (2021/08/11) ― archive editor:
──────────────────────────────────────────
This is the 6502 assembler, being updated to C99, originally posted by Joel Swank in 1987
The original file manifest is in Manifest.txt.

The original readme (modulo changes in layout) is below and is subject to future revision, as changes are made to this code.

This directory contains the source for a portable 6502 assembler written in C.
I captured it from the net and improved it and ported it to the Amiga.
I compiled it under Manx.
The port required only minor changes.
There are 2 documentation files - as6502.man and as6502.notes.
The source in UNIX nroff format for these files are as6502.1 (use -man) and user.nr respectively.
A test source file, AssmTest.in, and the resulting listing file, AssmTest.ex, are included.
These can be used to check functions after compiling.
Type the following:
	as6502 -nsv AssmTest.in >Assm.ex
then compare Assm.ex to AssmTest.ex.
They should be the same except for the dates in the headings.
