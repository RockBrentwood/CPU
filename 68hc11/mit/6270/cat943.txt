The goal of 6270 Technologies is to try to provide access to the 6.270
technology developed at MIT for the 6.270 Course.  The main products are
the 6.270 boards, LEGO, batteries, and spare parts, but now we are
trying to distribute additional mobile robot kits.

SPECIALS

All specials are delay delivery specials.  Orders must be placed by
October 20th, and delivery will be by the end of November.

RUGWARRIOR-U 
Unassembled Rug Warrior mobile robot kit.  Includes all
components to build a Rug Warrior from the book Mobile
Robots:Inspiration to Implementation by Jones and Flynn.  Contains the
parts listed in the book to make the processor board with the PCB board.
 Also included are enough LEGO pieces to build the chasis for the robot,
the servos to allow the robot to move, a copy of the public domain IC,
with manuals, and a serial download cable.  This kit will allow you to
get going with your Rug Warrior project.  This is a special offer good

6.270 Controller System

The 6.270 Controller System is comprised of 3 main components and 2 side
components.  The heart of the system is the Controller Board, Expansion
Board, and LCD.  The system was designed to teach undergraduates at MIT
about robotics, and systems intergration during a one month intensive
course.  The boards were designed to allow for flexibility and
creativity in the robots the students built.  Therefore, the boards do
not contain any sensors built on them like the Rug Warrior system, but
instead contain ports in which you can plug your sensors and actuators
into

Controller Board

The 6.270 system is based on the Motorola 6811 microprocessor with a 32K
RAM.  The controller board can run on its own, but an additional
expansion board allows for more ports and an LCD helps in debugging the
system.  The memory is battery backed with the processor batteries in
place.  When using the Interactive C environment, about 16K is available
for programming space.

Outputs:

The controller board features the control of 4 bidirectional motors. 
The motors are controlled through dual H-Bridge circuits to allow for
separate motor battery and controller battery power.  Using the IC
environment, the motors can be pulse width modulated to get different
speeds.  In addition, the currents supplied to the motors are fed back
to the processor's A/D to give you access to how hard the motors are
working.  In addition to the motor outputs there is a 40kHz modulated
output which can be used for ultrasonics, or IR transmission.  An LCD
can is connected to the board to allow for printing of states and
values.  This assists in debugging the system.  Also one servo output.

Inputs:

The board has 8 digital inputs and 4 analog inputs.  Two of the digital
inputs can be used to read shaft encoders and as accumulators.  Four of
the inputs can be used with the IR transmitter to look for specific
frequencies with the IC environment.  There is a serial input to connect
to a host computer for downloading.

Expansion Board

The expansion board provides for an addition 2 bidirectional motor
outputs, and multiplexes the analog input into 16 analog inputs.   There
are 4 dip switches and a frob knob for whatever comes to mind.  There is
also a prototyping space where you can interface your own circuits to
the board.

IR Transmitter 

The IR transmitter board is used for broadcasting IR in all directions. 
In the MIT contest, each robot transmits a modulated 40kHz of IR so the
other robot(s) can locate it.  This in conjunction with the SHARPIR can
allow for robot interaction.

Battery Charger Boards

The battery charger board is used for recharging the Gates Cyclon
batteries configured for 6 Volts. 


6270RBK-U -- Unassembled 6.270 Board kit 
Unassembled kit containing all the parts for the 6.270 controller
system.  The unassmbled kit is not recommended for people who do not
have soldering experience.  It contains the assembly manuals.
Cost: $225		S&H: $5

6270RBK-AX -- Assembled 6.270 Board kit 
Contains fully assembled 6.270 controller board, and expansion board. 
The IR transmitter board, battery charger and LCD are unassembled, but
the parts are included.  The 6.270 microprocessor system is fully
functional and in operational condition upon arrival.  This prevents
endless time in debugging and soldering that you may not want to spend.
Cost: $375		S&H: $7.50


Complete 6.270 Kits

The set of 6.270 kits provides you with a complete set of components to
explore mobile robots.  The kits were designed similar to the kits that
are given to the MIT 6.270 students.  They have been used at other
Universities and for robot competitions.  The kits are based on the
6.270 Controller system, and the LEGO Dacta system.  They allow you
flexibility to design many different types of robots from task specific
to generic robots.  These kits are idea for setting up a course or a
robot compeition 

Included in the complete kits:

1. 6.270 Controller System (assembled or unassembled) described earlier.

2. 6.270 manuals.  These are the course notes that are handed out to the
students when they are taking the course at MIT.  It includes
information about the boards, LEGO, senors, and Interactive C.

3. LEGOKIT1.  Contains LEGO for building the chasis and appendages for
your robot.  See LEGO section in the catalog for more information.

4. Sensors. Assortment of touch sensors that can be used as bump
sensors, or internal switches for actuators.  An assortment of IR
transmitter reciever pairs which can be used for reflectance, shaft
encoding, or determining ambiant light.  Also contains CdS photocells
for regular light.  The Sharp IR sensors are included for detecting
40kHz of IR light.

5. Motor Batteries.  Contains 2 sets of Gates Motor batteries. One can
be recharging while using the other set.  These batteries are combined
in series to provide 6V at 2.5ahr.

6. Acutators. 4 Mabuchi motors which can be interfaced with the LEGO
system, and one servo.

7. Serial Cable.  Serial cable to connect a DB9 RS232 with the
controller board.

8. Interactive C.  Pubically available version of Interactive C.

LEGO PARTS

6270 Technologies offers discounts on spare parts and some Resource Sets
from the LEGO DACTA line.  Purchases from $100 to $300 receive 5%
discount, $300 to $500 -- 10%, and over $500 is a 15% discount.  These
discounts apply to LEGO components that do not have a special price.

Since LEGO has been the key structural component to the 6.270 Robots
developed at MIT, we offer two sets of spare parts which provide ample
building material for small Mobile Robots.    These kits are the same as
the ones used in the MIT course.  Other kits provide by LEGO such as the
Resource Kits provide a good basic collection of LEGO.

6270 Technologies only deals with the LEGO DACTA division.  We do not
sell retail LEGO components.  LEGO DACTA is the Educational division of
LEGO System, and is used in schools throughout the school.  We feel that
it is a great tool along with the 6.270 System to teach systems
integration between mechanical and electrical components.
