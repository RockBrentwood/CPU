Welcome to the MC68HC11 mailing list. (last modified 15 March 1993)
 
This list is dedicated to discussions concerning the MC68HC11
single-chip microcontroller, its support chips, and the popular
EVB system.
 
Also, for the time being, discussions on the hc16 dsp chip
are welcome until such time as another forum is created, or
the volume of traffic dictates a split.
 
This is a semi-moderated group.  Requests to subscribe,
unsubscribe, or other administrivia is handled on a case by
case basis.
 
Please help keep the clutter in the group down. If you want
to subscribe, de-subscribe, or have other requests to make
about the mailing list, please send that sort of mail to
mc68hc11-request@hipp.etsu.edu rather than the submission address,
mc68hc11@hipp.etsu.edu. In order to avoid generating
endless mail loops (messages bouncing back and forth between
mindless mailers) some heuristics are applied to messages to
screen out those which appear to be errors or requests to be
added / deleted - if your message is less than 25 words or
longer than 5000 words, or contains "suspect" phrases
(such as subscribe) it will be routed to me and not sent
to the list.  If necessary, I'll post it manually when I have
a chance to look at it.
 
Additionally, please read the FAQ list below before posting.
Your question might be answered before you get your first
article!
 
Incidentally, hipp stands for the "Historic Image Processing
Project" - the main use of the storage on this PC.

0. "Who are you?"
 
        Nick Sayer orginated the list, but found it growing very
        rapidly and straining the connectivity resources of his machine.
        I voluenteered to take the list over since I've been using the HC11
        EVB in my classes for several years.  There are now about 300
        subscribers on the list located in 13 different countries.
 
 The list is originated at the Department of Computer and Information
 Sciences of East Texas State University, located in Commerce, Texas
 about 60 miles east of Dallas.  It was previously located in Flagstaff
 Arizona, but was moved from there due to the lack of support for the
 list and the fact that the administratior was laid off due to budget
 cutbacks in higher education in Arizona.
 
 Perhaps of some interest is that the list is being run on a 386 based
 PC using the GNU copyleft 386BSD unix system, a terrific piece of
 software for the price (free).

1. "What is the MC68HC11?"
 
 It is a group of single-chip microcontrollers made by Motorola
 based on the 6800 CPU. Unlike many such chips, however, the
 chip can boot into an extended mode which replaces two of
 the parallel ports with a complete address and data bus.
 The very same chip, therefore, can be used for prototype AND
 for the final product. This is truly a terrific chip!
 
 The base model is the MC68HC11A8. It has the 6800 CPU, 8K of
 factory programmed ROM, 512 bytes of EEPROM, 256 bytes of RAM,
 1 serial port, 8 A/D converters, a timer/counter unit, a serial
 communications channel (NOT an asynchronous serial port),
 and 5 parallel ports. The A1 is used in the EVB, and is the same
 thing without the ROM.
 
2. "What is the EVB or MC68HC11EVB?"
 
 It is a circuit board containing a MC68HC11A1, a PRU (port
 replacement unit - replaces the two ports taken up by the address
 bus), 8K of external ROM - which contains a powerful monitor, and
 two RS-232 ports.
 
 You can plug one end of a cable into the EVB and the other end
 into a socket in a product that would take a MC68HC11 and use
 the monitor to debug the prototype hardware, or plug that cable
 into a big storage scope and debug the software.... the mind
 boggles.
 
3. "How and/or where can I purchase an EVB?"
 
        For the past several years, Motorola has run a "student design
        contest" which has encouraged the use of the hc11/evb in
        university courses.  Thus universitys are frequently in a
  position to order the EVB (or you may find them available off
        the shelf at the U bookstore).
 
        A number of "standard" electronics and component suppliers also
        carry the board.
 
        The EVB actually comes in three flavors -
 
        The original EVB - which is what the moderator has used for several
        years in design courses - a terrific deal for students at the
original
        price of $68.11 (cute...).  Instead of having them buy a text
        (which would probably cost that anyway), they just bought an EVB
        and got to take the computer with them at the end of the semester.
        The course(s) was taught from the technical manuals included with
        the kit.
 
        The EVB requires a dumb ascii terminal or better (Mac or PC
        recommended) and a power supply with +5, and +/- 12 v (to run the
        RS232 interface).
 
        Unfortunately the current production status of the EVB is unknown.
 
        In the fall of 1991 Motorola introduced two new products, the EVBII
and
        the EVBU:
 
        The EVBII is a redesign of the EVB using "modern" technology, such
        as a charge pump chip to develop the RS232 voltages. It also has
        available a subsidary logic analyzer board.  I've not had time
        to look at this extensively yet.  Also, the price range is up around
        $150, making it too expensive for an individual student purchase
        plan (at least at state supported universities).
 
        To fill the gap left by the EVB, there is the EVBU (university
        model) which is available at the original EVB price of $68.11.
        (The last I heard, the EVB was available at $88, but hasn't been
        confirmed recently).  The EVBU is a usable microcontroller, but
        is limited in such respects as memeory supplied.  It does have
        a wire wrap area (and in fact one student group here this spring
        used and EVBU in a project and wire wrapped in a subsidiary
        EPROM chip - not a big deal). It also includes a Real Time
        Clock chip (although a number of boards received here early in
        the production run were missing it).
 
        Using a Mac or a PC with the EVB / EVBU / EVBII gives you a
        complete development system at a VERY reasonable cost (assuming
        you already have the computer).  Freeware / Shareware is
        available (cross - compilers, monitors, simple C compilers)
        either at the ftp site here or elsewhere.
 
        There was also an EVM (evaluation module) which was a higher
        level product than the EVB.  I'm not sure if it's still in
        production or what it might cost.
 
 The address and phone number for Motorola University Support is:
 
        Motorola SPS
        University Support 56-106
        P.O. Box 52073
        Phoenix, Az 85072
        602-952-3855
        602-952-3621 (FAX)
 
 There is an excellent introductory article in June 1991 issue of
 Computer Craft (formerly Modern Electronics) on M68HC11 micro-
 controller and the EVB along with the above mentioned pricing
 and availability infromation. Circuit Cellar also publishes
        articles from time to time on the HC11.
 
        HC11 information has also appeared in Circida's Circuit Cellar Ink,
        (he also had a column in BYTE magazine for a number of years)
        and Midnight Engineering magazine (strong on micro controller
content).
        Also, if you qualify, Embedded Systems magazine is very worthwhile
        (a "controlled circulation" magazine).
 
 I strongly recommend that anyone interested in buying the EVB should
 call the University Support to confirm availability and price, before
 sending in any money.
 
 Disclaimer: I am not connected with Motorola or Computer Craft in any
 way other than being a happy customer.
 
4. "How can I get in touch with Motorola to get technical info?"
 
 As far as I can tell, Motorola University support (as they like to
 call themselves) is headed by Fritz Wilson.
 
 His office is in the Semiconductor Products Sector in
 Phoenix, Arizona.
 
 Fritz: 602-952-3855
 
 They can help you with pretty much anything, but beware, it's
 usually pretty hard to get in touch with them, and they have
 a real annoying voice mail system. ;)
 
 All requests to them must be in writing.  Students should include
 a copy of their ID along with their written request.
 FAX requests are accepted at the FAX number: 602-952-3621.
 
 Otherwise, they give the address of:
 
 P.O. BOX 52073
 Phoenix, AZ 85072-2073
 
 But, on another card I received, there is also listed the following:
 
 3102 North 56th Street
 Phoenix, AZ 85018-6606
 
 When paying for something, they hold onto personal checks
 until they clear the bank, so you may want to send a cashiers
 check.  If you can get your university to pay for it, you
 can just send them the purchase order, and they will bill you.
 
5. "Where can I get support software?"
 
 Right Here! Just anonymous ftp into pub/hc11 on hipp.etsu.edu
        and you will find hc11 support software, mirroring the
        Motorola freeware bulletin board (see below).  Motorola
        has given permission to make this available to encourge
        wider distribution of hc11 tools via the Internet.
        I plan on reorganizing this when I get a chance to make it
        more logical. Honest.
 
        You can call the Motorola "Freeware BBS" at 512-891-FREE (3733)
 (1200/2400 bps). They have cross assemblers, sources for
 the BUFFALO monitors, etc.
 
        Other likely sites: here is an ARCHIE listing (as of 24 Apr 1992):

       The OLD archive/mailing site was rainbow.cse.nau.edu or alternately,
       red.cs.tcu.edu. These should NOT be used since they have been
       superceeded by the etsu site.
 
        If you find anything really neat at these sites, I'd appreciate
        a note so I can put it in here.
 
6.      What is the PowerGlove HC11 machine?
 
 The powerglove is a device originally manufactured for video game usage,'
 but which has been adapted as a general position sensitive input device.
 It's of interest here because one of the major interfaces was developed
 using the hc11 - doing an ARCHIE search turns up the following sites for
 more information.
