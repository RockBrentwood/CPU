Subject: Printing 6.270 docs on MSDOS
Status: O


     I have successfully printed some of the 6.270 docs on MSDOS.
Maybe you could add a little note to the README file.  I used the
latest version of Ghostscript and font files, all obtainable through
wuarchive.wustl.edu (or mirrors) in the msdos/postscript directory.
The current version of Ghostscript (v2.6.1) can print on the entire
Deskjet family of printers (great printers, IMHO), and also on
Epson Laserwriters and [of course] HP Laserjets.  There may be other
printers supported, but probably not generic dot matrix, though.
     I also decided to order the preprinted manual through MIT press,
since it is a good deal, a lot faster (Ghostscript needs to form
a bitmap image and print line by line on the printer, after all),
and it's spiral bound.
     But, for those adventurous souls out there, it is possible on
MSDOS.  I used the latest version of MSDOS gzip to unpack the files
(also obtainable on wuarchive).
     What I did print was the 6811 introduction and Chapter 1.
The printer made it halfway through Chapter 2, but ran out of paper,
and thus Ghostscript trashed the rest of the file (with only a few
pages left to go--of course).  The only problems I had were in
configuring Ghostscript, which just took a little hair-tearing..
