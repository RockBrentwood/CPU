SYNOPSIS

    slink [FROM <1+>] [TO <1>] [WITH <1>] [LIB <1+>] [MEM <range> <1+>]

            <1>  - one file
            <1+> - one or more files (separated by commas)
            <range> = <hex address>-<hex address>

DESCRIPTION

Slink is the linker for the DEV11 system. The following keywords are
recognized by slink:

FROM            Provides a list of object files that will become the root
                of the output file.  FROM must be used once and may be
                used more than once with each use adding to the root, but
                you must specify at least one file for each use.

LIB             Provides a list of library files to be scanned to resolve
                symbols not found in the root files. Only the modules
                containing the unresolved symbols will be included in the
                output file.  LIB can be used more than once.

MEM             Specifies an area of memory and provides a list of the
                segment names that are to be located in that area.  The
                linker must know where to place every segment that is used.
                MEM is usually used more than once.

TO              Specifies the output file to create.  The file will be an
                S-record format file. TO must be used once and only once.

WITH            Specifies a file that contains keyword commands to be
                processed by slink.  The file may be broken into lines,
                but each line must start with a keyword.  A WITH file
                can WITH another file and more than one WITH file may
                be used.  An example file might look as shown below.
                    FROM download.o
                    TO download.sr
                    MEM 100-7fff EXT_RAM
                    MEM 8000-83ff INT_RAM
                    MEM 0-ff ZPAGE
                    MEM fe00-ffd5 EEPROM
                    MEM ffd6-ffff VECTORS
