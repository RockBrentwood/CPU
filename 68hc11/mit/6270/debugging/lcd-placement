Subject: 6.270 LCD placement question
X-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0b -- ListProcessor by Anastasios Kotsikonas
Status: O

I just wanted to make sure I'm not doing something really stupid, since
I seem to be having a few problems getting my 6.270 board set working
properly.

Anyway, which way does the LCD plug into the expansion board? If it's
covering the board, with the connector in the upper-left, then the
capacitor at C15 gets in the way and the female headers on the right
side (analog input port) are partly covered.

And if it's stuck on the other way, it sticks out into the world...

Any tips?

Thanks,

Daniel S.
