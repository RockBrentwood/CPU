Oct 4, 1994

This is the freeware release of the C Cross Compiler for HC11. This
program is not in the public domain, but this release may be distributed to
other FTP sites or BBSs provided that all files are included as is without 
any modifications.

Note that general release of the compiler has been available since June 94.
See the end of this file.

The files included are:

freeware.txt	ascii version of the user manual
readme		this file
readme.cpp	readme file for the DECUS C preprocessor
readme.lcc	readme file for the lcc compiler front end
cpp.mem		description of the DECUS C preprocessor
icc11.exe	compiler driver
icpp.exe	C preprocessor
iccom11.exe	compiler
ias11.exe	assembler
crt.s		C runtime file
printf.c	simple printf like function
dhry.c		v 1.1 of dhrystone benchmark

Even though there is no relocatable linker included, the assembler, the
compiler and the compiler driver have been written such that mulitple files
of different types can be specified. For example, you may compile your
program and "link" it with the simple printf provided with these commands:

	icc11 <your C and asm files> printf.c
	or
	icc11 <your C and asm files> printf.s
		if you compile printf.c to printf.s first

This release fixes some bugs, exposes more command line switches to the user
(e.g., check for ANSI conformance), includes some rudimentary debugging
aid and adds a few more peephole patterns.

Note that the next release will likely use a modified version of Alan Baldwin 
relocatable assembler and linker. Assembler modules will need to be changed
when that happens. Note that this will be a giant step toward the general 1.0
release, so send it your favorite "much-have" features - 1) floating point
code generation, 2) libraries and header files, and 3) debugging.

The builtin peephole optimizer increases the code quality typically by
about 10%-20%.  On a 2 Mhz NMI SBC, I get ~200 dhrystones per second (V1.1). 
This is in comparison to 400 dhrystones per second as quoted by a $1200 
HC11 compiler vendor, and 200 dhrystones per second as quoted by the the 
same vendor on its major competitor costing $2000!

The assembler now supports the "sect" pseudo op, allowing code and data 
sections to have their own program counters. This is especially useful in
systems where the code would reside in EEPROM and data reside in RAM.

There is now a version of the "miniboard" library that is compatible with
icc11. For information on this library, please contact Fred Martin at
fredm@media.mit.edu. Miniboard is a single chip mode HC11 system with on
board motor drivers and sensors designed by Fred.

Change Log:
-----------
Feb 24 1994 release 0.48
	- fixed bugs in |= and &=
Feb 23 1994 release 0.47
	- fixed bugs with function call trashing local variables 
Feb 18 1994 release 0.46
	- negate was still not working properly
Feb 15 1994 release 0.45
	- negate was not working properly
	- unsigned char assignment to int was not working
Feb 14 1994 release 0.44
	- Peepholer went into an infinite loop if the '&' AND operator is
	  used.
Feb 8 1994 release 0.43
	- Fixed misc bugs
	- Added debbugging line labels and variables' offset table
	- Exposed more compiler switches
	- Better code generation for char data type
Jan 16 1994 release 0.42
	- A line was accidentally deleted in the src code resulting in embedded 
	  asm not being accepted
	- Documentation on embedded asm should mention instructions must start
	  with a space or tab
Jan 15 1994 release 0.41
	- The driver now supports environment variable ICC11_LIB
	- Better handling of / vs \ in file paths
	- The preprocessor now supports environment variable ICC11_INCLUDE
	- Several bug fixes in the code generator:
		. long operand names were output incorrectly
		. return sequence sometimes trashed register D
		. occasionally a short branch was generated when a long branch 
		  sequence should be used
	- Better error reporting from the assembler
	- Recompile using VC 1.5. The programs no longer run under OS2 protected
	  mode (a 32 bit OS2 and DOS version is available, please read the user
	  manual for information)
Dec 12 1993 release 0.40
	- Add a builtin peephole optimizer
	- Add embedded asm support
	- Add sect pseudo op to the assembler
Nov 16 1993 release 0.30
	- Recompile using 16 bit compiler. The system now runs on 8086 real (DOS,
	  386 VDM, DOS emulators) and 286 protected (OS2 1.X+) modes.
	- The calling convention has been changed so that it is not necessary to
	  save and restore IX in a function. This makes it more compatible with
	  existing libraries (such as the miniboard lib) and the resulting code
	  is faster too.
Nov 11 1993 release 0.20
	- full structure support (assignment, argument and function returning)
	- added support for signed divide and modulo 
	- better code generation for frame pointer access
	- assembler listing file was not being created
Oct 27 1993 release 0.11
	- hexadecimal and octal literal constants were not accepted
Oct 18 1993	release 0.1

*** General Release Info ****
====
**** Professional HC11 Tools At a Budget Price! ****

The ImageCraft HC11 C Compiler, ICC11, version 1.1

ICC11 is a high quality yet low cost compiler package that runs on the DOS 
environment. Included in the package are:

. NEW! Interspersed C and assembly output!

. NEW! Smaller memory requirements plus better code generation for byte
  variables!

. NEW! Ability to assign different names to text and data sections allowing
  better memory utilization.

. A comprehensive 90 page manual.

. A fast near-ANSI C (*) conformant compiler with built-in peephole optimizer.

. Quality code generation. Code size is typically only 5% to 20% larger than 
  expensive ($500 to $1200) compilers. 

. Assembler, linker, and librarian.

. Standard C header files and library functions.

. HC11 specific support such as embedded assembly, pragma for declaring 
  interrupt functions, etc.

. Calling conventions compatible with other compilers.

. Both 16 bit and 32 bit executables. 16 bit executables run on all DOS
  compatible environments including Unix/Mac DOS emulators. 32 bit
  compiler runs on DOS and DPMI DOS VDM including Windows and OS2 DOS
  VDMs.

. Technical support over the Internet, including a mailing list for 
  discussions and product update information.

. MIT Interactive C compatible multitasking kernel library.

. Miniboard library. Source code included!

. COMING SOON! REXIS - low priced multitasking executive with subsumption 
  architecture semantics for robotic control.

. COMING SOON! Linux port!

Price: $45.00, plus $5.00 shipping and handling within the U.S. / Canada 
and $10.00 to overseas. CA residents please add 8 1/4% sales tax. 

$40.00 for library source. $40 for REXIS and $400 for source for REXIS.

----
(*) The following ANSI C features are not yet supported, but most are expected 
    to be released at some future date:

. Long data type is only 2 bytes, although limited 32 bit support is provided
  through typedef and library calls.

. The compiler does not yet support floating point code generation.

. A not quite full set of C library functions is supplied, but most of the 
  missing functions are not applicable to embedded applications.

. The preprocessor does not support trigraphs, and it only uses K & R macro 
  rescanning rules.
